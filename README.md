# grub-theming

GRUB as a boot-loader looks pretty ugly, but that's easy to fix.

## Finding a Theme

Finding a theme you like is completely up to personal taste.

My personal favorite theme at the moment is called "Distribution," and it includes a theme which has slight alterations depending on the version you select.

A good source I've found for some themes is [Gorgeous-GRUB](https://github.com/Jacksaur/Gorgeous-GRUB), but [pling.com](https://www.pling.com/browse?cat=109&ord=latest) is also a great source.
